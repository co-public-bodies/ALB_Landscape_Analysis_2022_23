    "text": "You can explore the data used for this analysis by visiting our ALB Data Explorer tool, which provides more granular insights into each ALB. This tool will let you build your own charts and tables with our data, so you can make comparisons between different ALBs.\n\nThe entire dataset for this analysis covering 2022/23 can also be downloaded by using the button below.\n\n\n\n Download 2022/23 ALBs Data\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets covering previous financial years from 2019/20 back to 2012/13 can also be found here: Public Bodies Publications. The Public Bodies Directory is a publication which has evolved over a number of years, and there have been numerous changes in the scope and definitions of variables collected for these historic publications. As such, care should be taken when making comparisons with data covering previous financial years.\n\n\n\n\n\nALBs are classified, among other factors, on their level of independence from their sponsoring department, as outlined in the ALB sponsorship code of good practice. Executive agencies are typically more closely aligned with their department who often define the policies that they must follow, however the EA can decide the operational details of how to implement those policies. Departments can’t set the policies of NDPBs and NMDs but can set the strategic framework which outlines their overarching goals. Non-ministerial departments are usually considered the most independent as they typically have their own direct relationship with HM Treasury for negotiating their budgets.\nNDPBs are further classified based on their function. Advisory NDPBs perform only advisory functions whereas Executive NDPBs typically deliver frontline services to the wider public. These subclassifications can inform the way that NDPBs operate. For example, Advisory NDPBs typically operate without a dedicated workforce, and their activities are typically funded directly from within their sponsoring department’s budget. In contrast Executive NDPBs typically have their own dedicated workforce, and have budgets allocated to them by their sponsoring department and HM Treasury.\nThe Public Bodies Handbook provides a much more detailed breakdown of classifications of public bodies and ALBs sponsored by the UK government.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of ALB classifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Source: HM Treasury managing public money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nThis website was built in"

Accordingly, these bodies also represented the vast majority all ALBs’ Total Managed Expenditure, at £316.64 billion (92.2%). As employers, these bodies also represented around half (%) of the entire ALB workforce, employing 205,209 FTE. Collectively, this represents how the ALB landscape is skewed towards 10 large ALBs, which are profiled below.\nNote: Whilst Network Rail represents 2 bodies within the data, as both Network Rail and Great British Railways, as they share the same resources we have counted them as 1 ALB for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nThis website was built in"

RDEL is also often used to cover the programme spending of ALBs, which can go towards front-line operations performed by the ALB. For example, while NHS England (£157.63 billion) and Education and Skills Funding Agency (£67.3 billion) collectively spent around 83.1% of all RDEL spending, the vast majority of their spending was RDEL Programme spending, which itself was mostly issued as Grants-in-Aid to towards other organisations to carry out frontline services.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data"

Most of this was attributed to HM Revenue and Customs, who spent £33.93 billion as AME, which was 93.55% of all ALBs’ AME spend. HMRC uses AME spending to cover payments for Child Benefits, tax credits and other benefits, reliefs and allowances, which are all susceptible to inflationary pressures. Using AME spending allows HMRC to account for volatile changes in inflation, which may reduce the value of these payments if they were spent under DEL, which is typically allocated years in advance.\nMany ALBs reported a negative value for their AME spending, which is often attributable to movements in provisions. Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount that need to be accounted for in ALBs’ financial statements.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data"

In 2022/23 this had risen to £343.55 billion, representing an increase of around 17.6% (£51.32 billion). Most of this increase in spend is seen in resource (day to day) spending of ALBs. Much like ALB budgets, these increases are primarily attributable to inflation during this time period, and the formal classification of Network Rail as an ALB for 2022/23.\nWhen making comparisons in ALBs’ spending with 2019/20, its important to note that the way AME was measured for 2022/23 differs from 2019/20. In the 2019/20 Public Bodies Directory, ALBs only provided their Resource AME (RAME), whereas for 2022/23 the Cabinet Office collected both RAME and Capitalised AME (CAME) as a single AME value. While this change was made to provide a complete picture of AME spending, CAME spending is relatively uncommon compared to RAME. Analysis by the Institute For Government covering 2021/22 suggests that most Government departments do not use CAME spending. As such, this difference is unlikely to affect the majority of ALBs.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data"

The workforce of ALBs sponsored by Ministry of Justice also increased by 13,256 during this time period.\nMachinery of Government changes in 2022/23 also saw the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy split apart into Department for Business and Trade, Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Department for Science Innovation, and Technology.

This can be classified as either Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) or within their Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL).

Conversely, DEL is typically the body’s main budget, and is used for more predictable spending, such as long-running programmes and projects.1\nDEL spend can be further broken down into Resource DEL (RDEL) and Capital DEL (CDEL). RDEL is the cost of running the organisation, which can be on the body’s programmes or the administrative cost for supporting the body. CDEL is expenditure that provides an investment for the body, such as buying property.\nThe RDEL and CDEL figures in this section are the sums that the body actually spent (known as actual spending outturn), rather than the body’s budget for it, As such, the spending for ALBs reported below may not directly match up with the values reported in ALB Budgets, which captures delegated budgets for 2022/23."

These individuals have direct oversight over organisation functions and are held accountable for the performance and strategy of the ALB.\nRemuneration for board members is dependent on several factors such as the functions of the organisation, annual income and skills required to fulfill the position.

These analyse several aspects of the board performance across factors such as: structure, processes and people. The reviews also analyse the boards interactions with primary stakeholders and it is important to ensure feedback on the board is recieved from external sources.\nThe chair is responsible for the intiation of these reviews. Internal reviews must be completed annually by each ALB. However, reviews by external must also be completed but these occur every three years.\nThe external review helps boards self-reflect by eliminating the function board members in the review increasing in objecivity.\nOutcomes of both internal and external reviews must be shared with the parent department for full transparency.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2022/23, 29% of ALBs had completed an internal board effectiveness review.\n\nPlotData"
