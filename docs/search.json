    "text": "You can explore the data used for this analysis by visiting our ALB Data Explorer tool, which provides more granular insights into each ALB. This tool will let you build your own charts and tables with our data, so you can make comparisons between different ALBs.\n\nThe entire dataset for this analysis covering 2022/23 can also be downloaded by using the button below.\n\n\n\n Download 2022/23 ALBs Data\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets covering previous financial years from 2019/20 back to 2012/13 can also be found here: Public Bodies Publications. The Public Bodies Directory is a publication which has evolved over a number of years, and there have been numerous changes in the scope and definitions of variables collected for these historic publications. As such, care should be taken when making comparisons with data covering previous financial years.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou say there are 304 ALBs that are currently active, but the dataset only shows 251 rows, why is this?\n\nWhile there are 251 rows in the data, certain bodies are represented in the dataset as a single row, to avoid double counting of their resources. There is a column on each summary table called ‘Number Of ALBs’ and a column in the machine-readable dataset called ‘overall_body_numbers’ which provides details on these ALBs. If you add these values together, they will total to the 304 ALBs that are currently active. The most prominent example of this are the Advisory Committees On Justices Of The Peace, which are 44 Advisory NDPBs represented as a single line in the data.\n\nWhy is there missing data for certain ALBs?\n\nThe data provided below was returned to the Cabinet Office at the discretion of ALBs and their sponsoring departments. While every effort was made to ensure the data was complete as possible, not all ALBs could answer each question. Questions about specific missing datapoints should be directed to the ALB or the ALB’s sponsoring department.\n\nWhy do some ALBs not report RDEL spending split into Administrative and Programme spending?\n\nWhile RDEL Admin and Programme spending is readily available for most ALBs, it could not be provided for certain ALBs. There are a number of reasons for this:\nSome ALBs have trading fund status, wherein their spending is not recorded within RDEL, CDEL and AME categories. As such, these ALBs will typically report £0 for these types of spending.\nOther ALBs operate on a cost-recovery model, wherein they carry out work on behalf of their sponsor department and charge them to recoup the costs of the work, meaning they do not have a delegated budget in the same way other ALBs do.\nSmall ALBs, such as Advisory and Tribunal NDPBs may only convene periodically, and therefore do not typically have a delegated budget from their sponsor department. Instead, any spending by these ALBs is often taken from their sponsor department’s budget, and often only covers items such as travel expenses for their chair or board.\n\n\n\n\nALBs are classified, among other factors, on their level of independence from their sponsoring department, as outlined in the ALB sponsorship code of good practice. Executive agencies are typically more closely aligned with their department who often define the policies that they must follow, however the EA can decide the operational details of how to implement those policies. Departments can’t set the policies of NDPBs and NMDs but can set the strategic framework which outlines their overarching goals. Non-ministerial departments are usually considered the most independent as they typically have their own direct relationship with HM Treasury for negotiating their budgets.\nNDPBs are further classified based on their function. Advisory NDPBs perform only advisory functions whereas Executive NDPBs typically deliver frontline services to the wider public. These subclassifications can inform the way that NDPBs operate. For example, Advisory NDPBs typically operate without a dedicated workforce, and their activities are typically funded directly from within their sponsoring department’s budget. In contrast Executive NDPBs typically have their own dedicated workforce, and have budgets allocated to them by their sponsoring department and HM Treasury.\nThe Public Bodies Handbook provides a much more detailed breakdown of classifications of public bodies and ALBs sponsored by the UK government.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of ALB classifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Source: HM Treasury managing public money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nThis website was built in"

    "text": "ALB spending categories\nThe total amount of money that an ALB spends is called Total Managed Expenditure (TME). This can be classified as either Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) or within their Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL). AME is demand-led expenditure that is typically hard to budget for in advance, such as pension or welfare claims. Conversely, DEL is typically the body’s main budget, and is used for more predictable spending, such as long-running programmes and projects.1\nDEL spend can be further broken down into Resource DEL (RDEL) and Capital DEL (CDEL). RDEL is the cost of running the organisation, which can be on the body’s programmes or the administrative cost for supporting the body. CDEL is expenditure that provides an investment for the body, such as buying property.\nThe RDEL and CDEL figures in this section are the sums that the body actually spent (known as actual spending outturn), rather than the body’s budget for it, As such, the spending for ALBs reported below may not directly match up with the values reported in ALB Budgets, which captures delegated budgets for 2022/23."

However, ALB running costs can also include money that is disbursed by the ALB to fund the operations of other organisations as grants-in-aid.

Most of this was attributed to HM Revenue and Customs, who spent £33.93 billion as AME, which was 93.55% of all ALBs’ AME spend. HMRC uses AME spending to cover payments for Child Benefits, tax credits and other benefits, reliefs and allowances, which are all susceptible to inflationary pressures. Using AME spending allows HMRC to account for volatile changes in inflation, which may reduce the value of these payments if they were spent under DEL, which is typically allocated years in advance.\nMany ALBs reported a negative value for their AME spending, which is often attributable to movements in provisions.

    "text": "Comparisons with 2020\nIn the 2019/20 Public Bodies Directory, the Total Managed Expenditure (TME) for ALBs was £292.22 billion. In 2022/23 this had risen to £343.55 billion, representing an increase of around 17.6% (£51.32 billion). Most of this increase in spend is seen in resource (day to day) spending of ALBs. Much like ALB budgets, these increases are primarily attributable to inflation during this time period, and the formal classification of Network Rail as an ALB for 2022/23.\nWhen making comparisons in ALBs’ spending with 2019/20, its important to note that the way AME was measured for 2022/23 differs from 2019/20. In the 2019/20 Public Bodies Directory, ALBs only provided their Resource AME (RAME), whereas for 2022/23 the Cabinet Office collected both RAME and Capitalised AME (CAME) as a single AME value. While this change was made to provide a complete picture of AME spending, CAME spending is relatively uncommon compared to RAME. Analysis by the Institute For Government covering 2021/22 suggests that most Government departments do not use CAME spending. As such, this difference is unlikely to affect the majority of ALBs.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data"

    "text": "You say there are 304 ALBs that are currently active, but the dataset only shows 251 rows, why is this?\n\nWhile there are 251 rows in the data, certain bodies are represented in the dataset as a single row, to avoid double counting of their resources. There is a column on each summary table called ‘Number Of ALBs’ and a column in the machine-readable dataset called ‘overall_body_numbers’ which provides details on these ALBs. If you add these values together, they will total to the 304 ALBs that are currently active. The most prominent example of this are the Advisory Committees On Justices Of The Peace, which are 44 Advisory NDPBs represented as a single line in the data.\n\nWhy is there missing data for certain ALBs?\n\nThe data provided below was returned to the Cabinet Office at the discretion of ALBs and their sponsoring departments. While every effort was made to ensure the data was complete as possible, not all ALBs could answer each question. Questions about specific missing datapoints should be directed to the ALB or the ALB’s sponsoring department.\n\nWhy do some ALBs not report RDEL spending split into Administrative and Programme spending?\n\nWhile RDEL Admin and Programme spending is readily available for most ALBs, it could not be provided for certain ALBs. There are a number of reasons for this:\nSome ALBs have trading fund status, wherein their spending is not recorded within RDEL, CDEL and AME categories. As such, these ALBs will typically report £0 for these types of spending.\nOther ALBs operate on a cost-recovery model, wherein they carry out work on behalf of their sponsor department and charge them to recoup the costs of the work, meaning they do not have a delegated budget in the same way other ALBs do.\nSmall ALBs, such as Advisory and Tribunal NDPBs may only convene periodically, and therefore do not typically have a delegated budget from their sponsor department. Instead, any spending by these ALBs is often taken from their sponsor department’s budget, and often only covers items such as travel expenses for their chair or board."
